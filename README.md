# cs360-Mobile-Architect-and-Programming

In this project, I was given starter code that established the basic structure of an Android Studio project, including the database and activity files. From there, I created additional code to implement the database logic, activity interactions, and user interface elements that supported the intended features of the application. My contributions included designing the layout files, connecting the UI to Java classes, and ensuring that the database handled storage and retrieval correctly. This required combining the provided framework with my own coding work to deliver a functional app.

This project also connects to the larger field of computer science, where developers are tasked with solving problems through systematic design and implementation. Computer scientists build applications that not only function but also serve user needs in reliable and ethical ways. Through this project, I approached the problem by breaking it down into smaller tasks—such as UI design, database handling, and testing—and then iteratively improving each piece. Additionally, I recognized my responsibility to consider user privacy and organizational needs by ensuring that the application only uses necessary permissions and that the data is handled securely. This reflects the ethical obligations of computer scientists to both end users and the organizations they serve.
